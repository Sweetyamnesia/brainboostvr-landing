    <h2>About BrainBoostVR</h2>
    <p>
      BrainBoostVR is the result of my passion for virtual reality, cognitive training, and making technology more accessible. 
      I wanted to create a VR experience that feels both engaging and meaningful, where users can actively improve their memory and focus while enjoying the journey.
    </p>

    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>
      I come from a background in psychology and educational digital devices, and I am currently expanding my skills in computer science. 
      Over the years, I have worked on multimedia instructional design, digital training projects, and user-centered learning experiences. 
      BrainBoostVR allowed me to bring together all these skills—pedagogy, UX/UI design, Unity development, and project management—into one immersive project.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      In BrainBoostVR, users can walk and teleport freely inside a virtual environment. 
      When you enter the virtual house, clear instructions guide you through the exercises. 
      Once the instructions are completed, a 5-minute timer starts, during which you must find and place objects in the correct locations. 
      Visual cues and sound feedback help you know if your actions are right. 
      At the end, a summary panel shows your score, errors, and time spent, giving you instant feedback on your performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I Built It</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to show how VR can make cognitive training more motivating and interactive, especially for rehabilitation purposes. 
      This project also gave me the chance to explore new technologies, learn Unity and C#, and design exercises that are both fun and challenging.
