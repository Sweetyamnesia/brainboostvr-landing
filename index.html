            <h2>About Me & BrainBoostVR</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Angela, a solo developer and lifelong learner passionate about Virtual Reality, serious games, and cognitive training. 
                My background combines <strong>psychology</strong>, <strong>educational digital devices</strong>, and ongoing studies in <strong>computer science</strong>, along with professional experience in multimedia, digital training, and public services.
            </p>
            <p>
                BrainBoostVR is born from this unique mix of skills and interests. It’s a VR project designed to help users improve their cognitive abilities through immersive and interactive exercises. In the VR environment, users can walk and teleport around a virtual house, follow guided instructions, and complete exercises that test memory, attention, and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project reflects my motivation to <strong>make technology engaging and accessible</strong>, and to explore innovative ways to support learning and rehabilitation. Feedback is provided in real time through colors and sounds, and users receive a final summary of their performance, including score, mistakes, and time spent.
            </p>
            <p>
                BrainBoostVR combines <strong>my knowledge in pedagogy, UX design, and VR development</strong>, allowing me to create a safe, interactive environment that is both fun and effective for cognitive training.
            </p>
